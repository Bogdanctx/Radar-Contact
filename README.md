After that, control your airspace! Give instructions to airplanes, helicopters and hot air balloons to arrive to their airports.

A flying entity will disconnect from your frequency when it is inside the arrival airport coverage area (the yellow circles). In order to disconnect, some conditions are required: altitude must be below 10000ft and the airspeed must be below 250 knots.
